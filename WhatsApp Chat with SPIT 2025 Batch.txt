31/12/21, 7:12 pm - +91 82758 20062: In
31/12/21, 7:13 pm - +91 77209 98676: 8gb ddr4 3200mhz ram +512ssd
31/12/21, 7:13 pm - +91 77209 98676: Min
31/12/21, 7:13 pm - +91 96997 82529: If programming is a necessity, try looking for good processors and large RAM size, 8 GB won't be enough
31/12/21, 7:13 pm - +91 96997 82529: However, there are many laptops which allow RAM expansion, so that's not a problem
31/12/21, 7:14 pm - +91 88502 17694: It's a good laptop man good intel chips to but is there only integrated graphics
31/12/21, 7:14 pm - +91 6378 628 115: Everyone here is confusing this nibba🥲
31/12/21, 7:14 pm - +91 88502 17694: 8 is enough man
31/12/21, 7:14 pm - +91 96997 82529: Gaming hai toh obviously gaming laptop lo, but that won't be great for travel and the battery's not so good
31/12/21, 7:14 pm - +91 96997 82529: Not in the future
31/12/21, 7:14 pm - +91 88502 17694: Ya with gtx or rtx u don't get battery life
31/12/21, 7:15 pm - +91 88502 17694: Ya but now it's ok we can upgrade later
31/12/21, 7:15 pm - +91 96997 82529: But then, like I said, a lot of laptops give you an option, so you don't have to break your heads on this one
31/12/21, 7:15 pm - Aarya Patil: Ya these laptops are meant to be connected to power outlet
31/12/21, 7:15 pm - +91 6378 628 115: Guys I never had a laptop before so plz don't confuse me
31/12/21, 7:15 pm - +91 6378 628 115: 🥲
31/12/21, 7:15 pm - +91 88502 17694: Yes I use mine with power outlet only
31/12/21, 7:15 pm - +91 88502 17694: Man do u play games?
31/12/21, 7:15 pm - +91 96997 82529: https://youtu.be/2fq1jEqIdj4
31/12/21, 7:16 pm - Aarya Patil: Which laptop do you have mate?
31/12/21, 7:16 pm - +91 6378 628 115: On mobile*
31/12/21, 7:16 pm - +91 96997 82529: https://youtu.be/8Je8DF730Ww
31/12/21, 7:16 pm - +91 96997 82529: This is my laptop
31/12/21, 7:17 pm - Divya SPIT: <Media omitted>
31/12/21, 7:17 pm - Adwait Comps B: Yes true
31/12/21, 7:17 pm - +91 96997 82529: Don't keep it full tho unless you never ever use it unplugged
31/12/21, 7:17 pm - +91 6378 628 115: This is what I was going to ask, is it good?
31/12/21, 7:17 pm - +91 88502 17694: Nice man but the battery life will be bad right?
31/12/21, 7:17 pm - +91 84548 52753: Hmm thanks
31/12/21, 7:18 pm - +91 88502 17694: Ya man ik I only charge upto 90
31/12/21, 7:18 pm - +91 88502 17694: It never exceeds 90
31/12/21, 7:18 pm - +91 96997 82529: If the college would require us to bring laptops, you may have to look otherwise
31/12/21, 7:18 pm - +91 96997 82529: And do let it discharge every now and then, every 2-3 days
31/12/21, 7:19 pm - +91 88502 17694: Ya man ik😅
31/12/21, 7:19 pm - +91 6378 628 115: I feel do dumb and stupid here🥲
31/12/21, 7:19 pm - Divya SPIT: 4-5 hrs battery according to reviews
31/12/21, 7:19 pm - +91 88502 17694: https://youtu.be/0cPRVaco898
31/12/21, 7:19 pm - +91 88502 17694: I have this one
31/12/21, 7:19 pm - +91 98218 60700: In
31/12/21, 7:20 pm - +91 88502 17694: With i5 and gtx 1650
31/12/21, 7:20 pm - +91 99755 08405: I think you should not buy a laptop now and wait for teachers or senior to tell us the best laptop
31/12/21, 7:20 pm - +91 96997 82529: I have to say
If you want a lightweight laptop which can game casually (for reference: AC Valhalla runs at 50-something fps on medium) then this is it
31/12/21, 7:20 pm - +91 6378 628 115: Yeah
31/12/21, 7:21 pm - +91 88502 17694: Only 50?? It has rtx right?
31/12/21, 7:21 pm - +91 96997 82529: They won't
31/12/21, 7:21 pm - +91 99755 08405: Teachers will tell us minimum specs and seniors can suggest us laptop with those specifications
31/12/21, 7:21 pm - +91 6378 628 115: But what about who dunno any coding/programming or any language not even basics of them.should he/she also wait?
31/12/21, 7:21 pm - +91 96997 82529: At 35w
It's also a thin and light, at 1.3 kg
31/12/21, 7:21 pm - +91 88502 17694: I would suggest i5 chip or equivalent in amd and some gtx graphics
31/12/21, 7:21 pm - +91 96997 82529: So I can lift it easily in one hand, and pump out respectable framerates from the system
31/12/21, 7:22 pm - +91 74986 96490: Blankies
31/12/21, 7:22 pm - +91 96997 82529: Dekho gaming ke liye agar ek graphics card rehta hai toh thik hai
31/12/21, 7:22 pm - +91 88502 17694: Autocad intel graphics pe chal jayega
31/12/21, 7:22 pm - +91 6378 628 115: Graphics card kya hota hai bhai log🤔
31/12/21, 7:22 pm - +91 6378 628 115: Kuch batao yaar
31/12/21, 7:22 pm - +91 99755 08405: You can start learning coding from videos and all its just that you wont be able to practice .
However there are some sites that you can use for practice but it will consume more time 
So the decision is yours
31/12/21, 7:23 pm - +91 88502 17694: Nice mine is 2.3 kg
31/12/21, 7:23 pm - +91 96997 82529: Vaise the 11th gen Intel integrated graphics do pack a punch, and 12th gen will come to laptops soon
31/12/21, 7:23 pm - +91 88502 17694: Ya
31/12/21, 7:23 pm - +91 99871 98492: 💀

31/12/21, 7:24 pm - +91 96997 82529: Arre in order to play games better and smoother, and also for works like 3d rendering and simulations, graphics cards help
31/12/21, 7:24 pm - +91 6378 628 115: Dumbell bana le

31/12/21, 7:26 pm - +91 96997 82529: <Media omitted>

31/12/21, 7:27 pm - +91 90042 98622: If I use mine at 144Hz and rtx for gaming the battery life is bad so recommended to plug in

But when I come down to 60Hz and low settings when I just want to code or casual browsing, the battery life is really good
31/12/21, 7:27 pm - +91 96997 82529: Another thing
31/12/21, 7:27 pm - +91 74986 96490: Check out asus
31/12/21, 7:27 pm - +91 96997 82529: Gaming, video editing, 3d rendering MUST NOT be done without the charger plugged in
31/12/21, 7:27 pm - +91 88502 17694: Same man I have settings to set It to 60 or 120 and the battery lasts much longer
31/12/21, 7:27 pm - +91 90042 98622: +1
31/12/21, 7:28 pm - +91 96997 82529: It is plainly bad for the battery
31/12/21, 7:28 pm - +91 88502 17694: Ya it's very bad
31/12/21, 7:28 pm - +91 88502 17694: Just drains the battery health
31/12/21, 7:28 pm - +91 74986 96490: What all games yall play?
31/12/21, 7:29 pm - +91 96997 82529: My laptop doesn't have above 60 fps, and has lower wattage to the graphics card, yet it's enough for me to play the few games I play
31/12/21, 7:29 pm - +91 96997 82529: I play Metal Gear Solid V
31/12/21, 7:29 pm - +91 90042 98622: I got bored playing fps since 5 years so I'm into rpg rn 🥴

31/12/21, 7:30 pm - +91 96997 82529: It's an old game so you don't need the best graphics to play the game
But it is one of the best games of all time
31/12/21, 7:30 pm - +91 74986 96490: Did u buy OW?

31/12/21, 7:31 pm - +91 90751 65800: Game runs smooth but while driving cars gets too much shuttering
31/12/21, 7:31 pm - +91 74986 96490: Hmm
31/12/21, 7:31 pm - +91 96997 82529: But since the wattage was low i wasn't getting good frames

31/12/21, 7:32 pm - +91 96997 82529: Vsync won't help in stuttering
31/12/21, 7:32 pm - +91 76668 55716: I have another laptop which can just run a code and nothing else😂

16/02/22, 4:32 pm - Aditya Agrawal: Does globalization mean the extinction of cultural diversity? Many would argue that we are witnessing the rise of an “increasingly homogenized popular culture” heavily influenced by the Western world—ideals, values, and culture.

Here's Vivek Jaju from SE IT writing about what 'cultural homogenization' exactly is.
